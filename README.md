# Learning Python.

This repository represents my programming learning
process with python 3 and it is focused only on the
basics.

All the files you see here are coding exercises I
did from many python books and codes created by me
using my imagination.

You may find some codes that are not either well
designed or clean enough (These are beginner first
steps).

## What I Have Learned
* Data types in Python.
* Variables.
* Lists.
* Working with lists.
* if Statements.
* Dictionaries.
* Sets.
* User input and while loops.
* Functions.
* Classes.
* Files and Exceptions.
* Testing your code.
* Getting help with dir() and help() command
in python shell.

I may eventually keep updating this repository with
more basic codes in order to reinforce the basic
knowledge acquired during my learning process, but I
will be more focus on intermediate and advanced
topics that will be published in other repositories.
